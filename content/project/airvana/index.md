- Mar 2010 – Jun 2010:
Integrated Strongswan with a smartcard chip (Atmel AT98SC) which acted as an
HSM. Developed an openssl engine to integrate strongswan (IPsec daemon) with
the smartcard/HSM drivers.
- Aug 2009 – Dec 2009:
IPsec hardware acceleration using iMX51 Sahara. Implemented a Linux kernel
crypto layer transform that made the Sahara crypto hardware available to the
linux kernel through the standard linux crypto APIs and thus making it available
to the IPsec module for offloading the encryption and hashing of IPsec packets.
- Nov 2008 – Dec 2008: Smartcard development. PKI, RSA, X.509.
Developed drivers for the Atmel smartcard chip and provisioning tools to
provision the smartcard with X.509 credentials and secret keys
- Oct 2008 – Nov 2008: PPPoE integration: uClinux, Blackfin,
Interpeak.Speakerbus, Hoddesdon and Maidenhead
- Oct 2007 – Aug 2008:
Designed, developed and tested a telephony gateway integrating RTP and T1/E1
based on a custom PowerPC board with a DSP daughtercard and running
Montavista Linux. Worked on an telephony turret device that supported SIP and
RTP calls. Wrote a CDR collection and dispatch module for the turret. Wrote a
CDR forwarding application that run on both Windows and Linux servers.
Developed multiple network python scripts for automatic testing of the devices.
Wrote scripts for manufacturing processes and testing.
