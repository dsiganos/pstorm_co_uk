I am a computer science graduate with prior experience in construction and IT support and I have always been a computer enthusiast. 

I have experience with C#, Java, Python, C++  HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP languages from both university and personal projects:

- I used Java to [simulate server failure](https://bitbucket.org/ntinosng/virtual-dfs-simulator) on distributed systems and to create my own [programming language syntax](https://bitbucket.org/ntinosng/calcdog-programming-language) with the use of ANTLR4 library. 

- I used Python to write a [client-server guessing game](https://gist.github.com/NtinosNG) with sockets and C++ to write a client-server [music streaming](https://bitbucket.org/ntinosng/musicstreaming-server) console application with sockets as well. 

- I used *Laravel* for a project called [“moviehook”](https://gitlab.com/NtinosNG/moviehook) where, I integrated APIs from *themoviedb.org* and *developer.nytimes.com*, and I contributed in scaling a software engineering [evaluation platform](https://bitbucket.org/ntinosng/percerons) by introducing JavaScript-based charts from *chartjs.org* and *d3plus.org* libraries. 

- Finally, I have built from scratch my [own theme](https://github.com/NtinosNG/self) for [HUGO](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.
